# FishingGameSite

This project aims to create a relaxing fishing environment one click away. This repository details the code necessary for the website to run together including the necessary rendering engine Pixi.js in order to create a seamless web browswer gaming experience.

This page will continue to be updated over time so file and function names are not set in stone.
